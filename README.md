# Description

### What is Seed?
We frequently find ourselves splurging on unnecessary goods on a whim. This extraneous spending builds up over time to a surprisingly large sum. Yet, we often shudder at the thought of donating even $15/year to a charitable cause.  

**Seed** is the solution for both of these issues; 
**Seed** cuts down on extraneous spending, while simultaneously increasing donations for various charitable causes.

### what does it do?
**Seed** allows you to set certain monthly budgets for items such as Bubble Tea or chips, while giving you the flexibility to spend past this budget cap. However, spending past this cap imposes a "charity tax" where a percentage of your spending is additionally charged and goes towards donations for a charity. This increases the "price" of the good, thereby reducing personal demand for the item once the "charity tax" is imposed.

# How to run 
open up two command line terminals.
For the first terminal, do the following:
1. cd to seed/seed-app
2. npm install
3. npm start

Then after doing the above, do the following on the other terminal:
1. cd to seed/seed-api
2. npm install
3. node server.js


# Notes

Due to time constraints, much of the frontend work has since been put on pause, so running the program currently probably won't be very useful.
